# TexasSexOffenderScraper
Updated version of the HAWK project, which uses Selenium to print registry results for a list of people: http://easternskies.net/Hawk/

Are you running a children's day-camp or youth retreat in Texas and need to print out registry search results for a list of adults? Hawk can help! Simply enter in your list of names, hit start, and Hawk will automatically open up and print registry results in new tabs using your browser.

I don't update this often so please email me if you'd like to get it working again!
